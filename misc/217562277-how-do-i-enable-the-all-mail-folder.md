# How do I enable the "All Mail" folder?

**Error message:** "Your accountÂ is missing the 'All Mail' folder. This is probably due to 'Show in IMAP' being disabled."

**Explanation:** Your Gmail account doesn't have an "All Mail" folder, preventing the Nylas Sync Engine from syncing it. Thankfully, it's easy to enable it!

To do it, you'll just need to sign in to Gmail from a web browser, go to [Settings / Labels](https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/labels) and check "Show in IMAP" next to "All Mail."
