# Will Nylas Mail support "Categories" from Gmail or "Bundles" from Google Inbox?

Unfortunately, Google's APIs and IMAP implementation do not provide third-party mail clients with access to the special filtering features within Gmail or Google Inbox, including:

*   Social, Promotions, etc. categories within Gmail
*   Priority Inbox
*   Bundles, Highlights and Reminders in Google Inbox

We may implement similar mail organization in the future on our own, but it's unlikely that Google will improve third-party support for these features.
