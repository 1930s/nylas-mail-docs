# Uninstalling Nylas Mail

We're sorry to see you go!

In addition to the application itself, Nylas keeps a mailbox cache, downloads, and so on on disk. Here's where you can find the files on various platforms:

<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Mac OS X</span>

*   /Applications/Nylas Mail.app
*   ~/.nylas (a hidden folder within your home directory)

<span style="font-size: large;">Windows</span>

*   ~/AppData/Local/nylas
*   ~/.nylas (a hidden folder within your home directory)
*   You may also need to remove a desktop shortcut

<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Linux</span>

*   You can use your package manager to uninstall N1 ie: `sudo apt-get remove nylas`
