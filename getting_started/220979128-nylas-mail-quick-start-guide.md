# Nylas Mail Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Nylas Mail! Here’s how to get started. 

**Set up an email account**

First, go to Preferences > Accounts to set up your email. You can [set up multiple accounts](/hc/en-us/articles/221043647-Setting-up-multiple-accounts) from [multiple email providers](/hc/en-us/articles/221043627-Supported-email-providers).

When you set up an account, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to build a complete cache of your mailbox. However, Nylas Mail is designed to pull recent messages first, so you should be able to get going quickly. Total sync time will be dependent on factors like total number of messages, your network bandwidth, processing power, and your email provider's throttling.

**Customize your inbox view**

You can customize your inbox experience in a variety of ways:

*   Configure your notifications and reading/sending settings at Preferences > General
*   Choose a single panel (Gmail style) or two panel (Outlook style) layout
*   Choose a theme (or create your own!)
*   Configure your keyboard shortcuts
