By enabling you to connect directly with Salesforce — the single most popular system of record for sales organizations—from inside the inbox, Nylas N1 turns what was previously a tedious, productivity-killing process into a delightful experience. You can create and edit contacts, leads, opportunities, and accounts directly from your messages, and you can sync threads with your Salesforce opportunities.
