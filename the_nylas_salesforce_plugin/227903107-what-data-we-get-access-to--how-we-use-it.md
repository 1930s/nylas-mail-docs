# What data we get access to & how we use it

We create and update Accounts, Opportunities, Tasks, Email Messages, Leads, and Contacts.

We use the [Salesforce REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/REST_API) as well as the [Salesforce Streaming API](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Streaming_API) to read from and write to your Salesforce objects.

The Salesforce API enforces permissions and settings you have setup in your Salesforce installation.

We use the secure and sanctioned authentication system, [OAuth](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/OAuth), to gain access to an individual userâ€™s account. We never store nor have access to your Salesforce password and comply with any two-factor authentication systems you may have enabled. We are granted an access token that you may invalidate at any time.
