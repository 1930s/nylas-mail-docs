# Offline account access

Nylas Mail allows you to read, compose, and schedule messages as usual while offline.

Your ability to see images and attachments while offline depends on how youâ€™ve configured Nylas to download attachments. These are your options:

*   **When received** provides maximum readability and access while offline
*   **When read** means you will only be able to view images and attachments you have previously opened if you go offline
*   **Manually**

Messages you send while offline will be queued and sent when you reconnect to the internet.
