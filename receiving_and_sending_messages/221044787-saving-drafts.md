# Saving drafts

Unsent drafts will be auto-saved to the Drafts folder as you write. You can view drafts for each of your accounts separately or together.

Any messages youâ€™ve scheduled using the Send Later function will also be saved to your Drafts folder. You can edit the message at any point before the scheduled send time.
