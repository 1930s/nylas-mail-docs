# Customizing Nylas Mail

Nylas Mail is designed from the ground up to be customized and extended. There are several ways you can do this:

<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Install plugins</span>

Plugins add new functionality to Nylas Mail. You can [activate](/hc/en-us/articles/221043467-Activating-plugins) or deactivate them at any time. More than a dozen plugins are built in directly to Nylas Mail. Go to Preferences > Plugins to see a list of what’s available, then toggle to install.

Developers can clone or download additional Nylas Mail plugins via [GitHub](https://github.com/nylas/n1#plugin-list). Many of these plugins are community-contributed, and the selection will continue to grow over time.

<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Install custom themes</span>

The design of Nylas Mail is customizable. Choose from several prebuilt [themes](/hc/en-us/articles/217557858-How-do-I-change-my-theme-) in Preferences > Appearance, or download and install new themes [here](https://github.com/nylas/n1). And if you’re familiar with CSS, you can create your own!

<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Adjust your preferences</span>

From the standard Preferences panel, you can change settings like the display mode, how unread counts are shown, notification settings, sounds, and many others.

<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Write your own plugin</span>

Nylas Mail is designed to make it easy for developers who are familiar with modern web technology to quickly and easily build plugins of their own. Take a look at the [Nylas Mail Github project documentation](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-mail) for guides on how to get started.

<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Contribute to Nylas Mail Core</span>

Nylas Mail is an [open source project](https://www.github.com/nylas/n1). We welcome and encourage developers to submit pull requests.
