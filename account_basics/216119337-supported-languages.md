# Supported languages

Nylas Mail currently supports only English (US), but we are looking into adding support for other languages, including RTL languages, soon.

If you are interested in volunteering for translations, check out this GitHub issue: [https://github.com/nylas/N1/issues/24](https://github.com/nylas/N1/issues/24). As soon as we can put a scaffold in place for language contributions, we'llÂ let you know how you can help.
