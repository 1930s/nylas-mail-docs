# Resetting your Nylas ID password

If you forgot your Nylas ID password or need to reset it, you can visit https://billing.nylas.com/forgot to reset your password. 

You can also do this from inside N1; when you open N1, if you haven't signed in to your Nylas ID, you will see the login screen. Select the link "Forgot your password", which will take you to the next section where you can reset your password.![](./212470007-Screen_Shot_2016-09-21_at_11.57.38_AM.png)
