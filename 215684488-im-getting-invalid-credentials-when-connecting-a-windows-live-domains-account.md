# I'm getting "Invalid Credentials" when connecting a Windows Live Domains account.

Unfortunately N1 doesn't support connecting [Windows Live custom domains](https://www.domains.live.com/) accounts, since they've been deprecated by Microsoft.

However, since those accounts aren't much more than aliases to a regular Outlook.com account, you should be able to connect your original @outlook.com account and to set up aliases within N1.
