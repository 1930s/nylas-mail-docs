Nylas Mail is free!  

Nylas Pro is a different application and has a subscription.  Nylas Pro uses the Nylas Cloud APIs to provide many advanced features, such as Send Later, Snooze, Mail Merge, and access to the Salesforce plugins.  When you install Nylas Pro, there's a free trial so you can [try Nylas Pro free for 14 days](/hc/en-us/articles/220976228-Signing-up-for-a-30-day-free-trial-of-N1)! After that, it's $12/month to subscribe.

In the future, we’ll also offer a team-oriented edition of Nylas with enhanced features for collaboration. To learn more and join the waiting list, visit [nylas.com/pricing](http://nylas.com/pricing).
